# Wireshark

This folder contains writeups of things I’ve explored with Wireshark.  
Each subfolder is its own focused look at a specific topic I noticed in packet captures and wanted to understand better. The goal is to use Wireshark to analyze and learn about my DNS traffic, Pi-hole, and how they interact on my network.
